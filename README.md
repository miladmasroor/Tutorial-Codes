# Tutorial Codes (I instructed graduate and undergraduate students in Python programming at the University of Tehran from April to June 2022)

**From April to June 2022, I had the privilege of serving as an instructor at the University of Tehran, where I provided valuable guidance to both graduate and undergraduate students in the field of Python programming. My role involved empowering students to develop machine learning and deep learning techniques, facilitating their growth and proficiency in these critical areas of study.**

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebook tutorial codes aimed at providing hands-on learning experiences in various areas of machine learning, deep learning, and data analysis. Each Jupyter Notebook explores a specific topic, allowing you to run and experiment with the code while understanding the underlying concepts.

## Table of Contents

1. [Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for CIFAR-10 Image Classification](Convolutional_Neural_Network_(CNN)_for_CIFAR_10_Image_Classification.ipynb)
    - Description: This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
   
2. [Exploring Polynomial Regression with Varying Polynomial Degrees](Exploring_Polynomial_Regression_with_Varying_Polynomial_Degrees.ipynb)
    - Description: In this tutorial, we delve into polynomial regression, analyzing how different polynomial degrees impact the model's performance.

3. [Polynomial Regression Analysis with Linear and Non-Linear Models](Polynomial_Regression_Analysis_with_Linear_and_Non_Linear_Models.ipynb)
    - Description: Explore the world of polynomial regression with a focus on understanding linear and non-linear models, showcasing their applications.

4. [Simple Neural Network (MLP) in Keras](Simple_neural_network(mlp)_in_keras.ipynb)
    - Description: This Jupyter Notebook guides you through creating a basic Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network using the Keras framework.
5. [Transfer Learning - Part 1](Transfer_learning_part1.ipynb)
    - Description: In this notebook, we will explore the approach of Transfer Learning, specifically utilizing a pre-trained model as a feature extractor. This technique involves leveraging a pre-existing neural network to extract valuable features from data, enhancing the efficiency and performance of our machine learning or deep learning models.
6. [Transfer Learning - Part 2](Transfer_learning_part2_and_Fine_tuning.ipynb)
    - Description: In this notebook, we will explore the concept of Fine Tuning and its application to our model. Fine Tuning involves making further adjustments and refinements to the model to enhance its performance and adapt it to specific tasks or data.
7. [Fashion MNIST Classification with TensorFlow and Keras](Fashion-MNIST-Classification-with-TensorFlow-and-Keras.ipynb)
    - Description: This Python code is an implementation of a deep learning model for classifying images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The Fashion MNIST dataset contains grayscale images of various clothing items, each belonging to one of ten classes.
8. [K-Means Clustering on Diverse Synthetic Data](K-Means-Clustering-on-Diverse-Synthetic-Data.ipynb)
    - Description: This Python code uses the scikit-learn library to perform K-Means clustering on various synthetic datasets. It generates different types of data, including circles, moons, blobs, random points, and anisotropic (elongated) clusters, and then applies K-Means clustering to find distinct clusters within each dataset. The code also plots the resulting cluster assignments and cluster centers, as well as the inertia values for different numbers of clusters to help determine the optimal cluster count.
